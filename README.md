# RenyiStyleGAN
  
Please clone the official StyleGAN code at `https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan` and replace the `train.py` and `training/loss.py` with
the files in this repository to run RenyiStyleGAN.
You can control the &alpha; parameter in the `train.py` file and add simplified gradient penalty in
`training/loss.py`.
